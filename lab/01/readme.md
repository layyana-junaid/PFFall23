# Layyana Junaid
## 23k-0056
### I did my Olevel and Alevel from Beaconhouse School System.
### The letter "L" in my name stands for Layyana itself as it defines my personality, being soft spoken and the letter "J" in my name stands for journaling as journaling has helped me with organizing myself.
